The Leaflet DVF is an extension to the [Leaflet](http://www.leafletjs.com) JavaScript mapping library.
The primary goal of the framework is to simplify data visualization and thematic mapping.

It includes:

New marker types (see the markers example below):

* [MapMarker](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/6.-Markers#lmapmarker) - create an SVG-based map marker similar to Leaflet's image-based marker, but fully customizable via L.Path style properties
* [RegularPolygonMarker](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/6.-Markers#lregularpolygonmarker) - create N-sided shapes like triangles, squares, hexagons, etc.
* [StarMarker](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/6.-Markers#lstarmarker) - create stars with N points
* [ChartMarkers](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/6.-Markers#chartmarkers) - useful for displaying multiple data properties at each location:
	* BarChartMarker
	* PieChartMarker
	* RadialBarChartMarker
	* CoxcombChartMarker
	* RadialMeterMarker
	* StackedRegularPolygonMarker - a variation on the bar chart
	* SparklineMarker - graph-based markers for illustrating time series and other x, y data in a geospatial context (Coming soon)

Functions for easily mapping data properties to Leaflet style values:

* [LinearFunction](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/5.-Utility-Functions#llinearfunction)
* [Color functions](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/5.-Utility-Functions#colorfunctions):
	* HSLHueFunction - vary the output hue based on a data property
	* HSLSaturationFunction - vary the output saturation based on a data property
	* HSLLuminosityFunction - vary the output lightness/luminosity based on a data property
	* Various RGB functions
	* Built-in support for [Colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org) color scales
* [PiecewiseFunction](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/5.-Utility-Functions#lpiecewisefunction) - use multiple LinearFunction classes in sequence (e.g. vary a color from white to yellow, yellow to red)
* [CustomColorFunction](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/5.-Utility-Functions#lcustomcolorfunction) - specify the specific color scale to use.  Use L.ColorBrewer to specify Colorbrewer scales.

New layer types that simplify reading and visualizing any JSON-based data structure:

* [DataLayer](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/8.-Datalayers#ldatalayer)
* [ChartDataLayer](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/8.-Datalayers#chartdatalayers) and corresponding DataLayer instances for various chart types
* [ChoroplethDataLayer](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/8.-Datalayers#lchoroplethdatalayer)
* [Others](https://github.com/humangeo/leaflet-dvf/wiki/8.-Datalayers#lmarkerdatalayer)

GeoJSON polygons for countries and US states to support Choropleth mapping.  Countries are generated from:  https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json.
Just include these JavaScript files if you plan to build a country or US state choropleth.
Polygons are indexed via a state or country code and lookups are created to map various state/country code formats to the default index format.

Automatic legend generation and a simple legend control.
To generate a legend, just call getLegend on any DataLayer, or use the provided legend control and the legend will be displayed automatically.

Support for gradient fills and drop shadows, text on Path-based items (e.g. markers, polylines, polygons, etc.), and more.

Callouts for annotating map data.  Use the L.Callout class to add individual callouts to your map.  See the [Markers](http://humangeo.github.com/leaflet-dvf/examples/html/markers.html) example for an illustration of callouts.

*NOTE:  The dist folder includes a minified version of the full framework as well as a minified version of the code required to use the new markers*
*Use leaflet-dvf.markers.min.js if you want to use the new markers without the rest of the framework*
