The Leafet 0.8/master branch has a number of major changes that break leafet-dvf functionality.  The 0.8dev branch has been setup as an initial attempt to resolve these issues and make the library compatible with Leaflet 0.8.  This is a work in progress, but it should be updated frequently.  More details will be added here as progress is made.
